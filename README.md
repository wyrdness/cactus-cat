## Description

The Cactus Cat is a humorous creature from American lumberjack folklore, representing the fearsome critters tradition adapted for desert environments. This bobcat-sized animal is covered in cactus-like thorns and spines, with a distinctive branched tail armed with sharp points.

According to the tall tales, the Cactus Cat prowls the desert at night, using its armored front legs to slash barrel cacti and saguaros. The cactus sap oozes out and ferments in the desert heat. Days later, the Cactus Cat returns to drink the alcoholic juice, becoming thoroughly intoxicated. In its drunken state, it produces terrifying screams and howls that echo through the canyons.

## Cultural Significance

The Cactus Cat is a **fearsome critter**, a type of tall tale creature invented by American lumberjacks and outdoor workers. These absurd beings were described to greenhorns (new workers) as genuine local hazards, serving as both entertainment and hazing ritual.

The tradition likely spread from lumber camps to mining and railroad camps in the Southwest, where workers adapted the fearsome critters concept to desert environments.

## Notes

**This is folklore, not cryptozoology.** The Cactus Cat was never intended to be believed. It represents occupational humor and the tall tale tradition of American frontier workers. The creature's drunken antics served as comic relief and a way to test newcomers' gullibility.
