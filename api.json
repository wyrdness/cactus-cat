      "full": "The Cactus Cat is a fearsome critter from American lumberjack folklore, adapted for the southwestern deserts. This cat-sized creature sports thorny, cactus-like fur and a branched tail covered in sharp spines. According to the tales, it roams the desert at night slashing cacti with its spine-covered front legs, allowing the sap to ferment. Days later, it returns to drink the fermented juice, becoming wildly drunk and producing unearthly screams and howls. The Cactus Cat is a classic example of occupational folklore used by experienced workers to haze newcomers with absurd tall tales presented as local hazards."
